# gatsby recipes

Pull data from an external source and creating pages without GraphQL:

You donâ€™t have to use the GraphQL data layer to include data in pages, [though there are reasons why you should consider GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/why-gatsby-uses-graphql/).

You can use the node createPages API to pull unstructured data directly into Gatsby sites rather than through GraphQL and source plugins.

In this recipe, we create dynamic pages from data fetched from the [PokÃ©APIâ€™s REST endpoints](https://www.pokeapi.co/). The _original_ full example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-with-unstructured-data/).

Install necessary NPM package [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

<NPMPackage name='axios' />

Awesome!

Now, in gatsby-node.js, we add the JavaScript code to fetch data from the PokÃ©API and programmatically create an index page:

<File
  path='gatsby-node.js'
  content='https://gist.githubusercontent.com/toddmath/d3ff1bee961105f0566b29d3255b58d4/raw/f66184327584aecee079ae3f1c54563417807ced/gatsby-node.js'
/>

---

Nice!

Next we create a template to display PokÃ©mon on the homepage:

<File
  path='src/templates/all-pokemon.js'
  content='https://gist.github.com/toddmath/d3ff1bee961105f0566b29d3255b58d4/raw/f66184327584aecee079ae3f1c54563417807ced/all-pokeman.js'
/>

---

Great! run gatsby develop and point your browser at localhost:8000/pokeman to see our created page.
