# Create custom React hook to query siteMetadata

In this recipe we create a React custom hook composed of `useStaticQuery`.

Prerequisites:

1. Youâ€™ll need React and ReactDOM 16.8.0 or later (keeping Gatsby updated handles this)

2. Recommended reading: the [Rules of React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)

Based off: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/querying-data

First up, let's create our custom hook!

<File
  path='src/hooks/useSiteMetadata.js'
  content='https://gist.github.com/toddmath/66a4b0d99bce942d56ad246086e7cf4e/raw/c5eb5c2e0d9bfa98ce61bca734d51bf8ae48034e/useSiteMetadata.js'
/>

That was easy!!

Now, let's update our `seo.js` component to use it.

<File
  path='src/components/seo.js'
  content='https://gist.github.com/toddmath/66a4b0d99bce942d56ad246086e7cf4e/raw/c5eb5c2e0d9bfa98ce61bca734d51bf8ae48034e/seo.js'
/>

Finished! The great thing about hooks is their flexibility and composability.

Any component or page where you need this data it's as easy as importing the hook and calling it.

You can experiment with writing your own hooks to query any data you want.
